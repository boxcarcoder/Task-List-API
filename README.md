# Task-List-API

This is an API as well as backend code for my Task List project. My server uses nodeJS and various node packages, including Mongoose to interact with my instance of MongoDB, and Express to create a server. The server allows interaction between my frontend and my database. I implemented a model, routing, and controller as means to allow communication between my task list and the database. 

The frontend code for the task list can be found here: https://github.com/boxcarcoder/Task-List
